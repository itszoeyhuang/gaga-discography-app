Any challenges you faced and how you overcame them
- I was struggling with installing Tailwindcss since the same error messege kept popping up. However, the problem was solved as I rechecked the packagae.json file and imported @tailwindcss correctly to the designated files.
- I implement the plain emoji text for my toggle button as the ionicon Ui blocked the toggle function. 
- I did spend some time understanding and reading through the correct Tailwindcss usage.
